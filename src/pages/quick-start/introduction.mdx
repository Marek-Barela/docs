# Introduction

## To-do App
We are going to build a very simple to-do app with Nhost and React. We use React here but Nhost is framework agnostic, so you can use whatever framework you like.
We will start by creating a project on Nhost followed by a React application for listing and creating to-dos, initially without authenthication. 

## Help

The quick start is simple enough that we expect you to not find any issues, but if you do, please reach out to us on **discord** or by **email**.

### Templates

shall we put the templates here?
