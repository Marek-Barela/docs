title: "Todos Table"
---

We need a table to store the todos that our application will manage, and also correct permissions on querying and inserting them. Hasura Console to the rescue.

> Hasura Console is where you manage your project's database and GraphQL API.

## Hasura Console

Go to **Hasura**. Go ahead and copy Hasura's **Admin secret** and use it to login to the **Hasura console**.

If you are not familiar with the Hasura Console, now it is a good time to click around and explore.

## Create todos table

Click on **DATA** tab on the top menu, and click on **Create Table**.

We'll create a `todos` table:

| Name         | Type      | Default value     |
| :----------- | :-------- | :---------------- |
| id           | UUID      | gen_random_uuid() |
| created_at   | Timestamp | now()             |
| name         | Text      |                   |
| is_completed | Boolean   | false             |

For the `id` and `created_at` you should use the **Frequently used columns** option. This ensures correct name, type and default values for those columns. It's a quick way to get started creating a new table.

The other columns, `name` and `is_completed`, you need to add manually (see the image bellow). Make sure you set the **default value** for `is_completed` to `false`.

Scroll down and click **Add table**.

### Query Data

To make sure we have a working GraphQL API, we will now insert two todos. Click the **Insert Row** tab and create two todos by specifying a **name** and clicking on **Save** (see the animation bellow).

Once you've added the todos, go the GraphiQL tab to query the data. **Copy-and-paste** the following query and click the **play button**.

```graphql
query {
  todos {
    id
    created_at
    name
    is_completed
  }
}
```

You should see your todos to the right as a response.

## Permissions

Right now, the only way to query todos is by using the **admin** role with an admin-secret (`x-hasura-admin-secret`). We are going to change that behavior so that **anyone** (`public`) is able to insert and select todos.

In the Hasura Console, go to your **todos** table and click on **Permissions**. We will set **insert** and **select** permissions for the **public** role.

> The `public` role is used by users that are not logged in.

### Insert

**Row insert permissions** should be set to **Without any checks** and **Column insert permissions** should only have **name** checked.

### Select

**Row select permissions** should be set to **Without any checks** and **Column select permissions** should have all columns checked.

Anyone can now **insert** and **select** todos. This is not secure, but it's a good start. We will secure our backend later when we add authentication.
