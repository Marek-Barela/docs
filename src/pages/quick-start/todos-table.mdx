summary: Build a simple React App with Nhost backend. You will learn how to create tables, CRUD data with GraphQL and use authentication.

We need a table to store the todos that our application will manage, and also correct permissions on querying and inserting them. Hasura Console to the rescue.

> Hasura Console is where you manage your project's database and GraphQL API.

## Hasura Console

On your project's dashboard, click on the `Hasura` option on the left-side menu. You will find details of the Hasura installation, as well as an option to add `Environment Variables`. Go ahead and copy Hasura's `Admin secret` and use it to login to the `Hasura console URL`.

If you are not familiar with the Hasura Console, now it is a good time to click around and explore.

## Create `todos` table

Please make sure the `DATA` tab on the top menu is selected, and click on `Create Table` 

We'll create a `todos` table with the following columns:

| Name       | Type      | Default value     |
| :--------- | :-------- | :---------------- |
| id         | UUID      | gen_random_uuid() |
| created_at | Timestamp | now()             |
| name       | Text      |                   |
| completed  | Boolean   | false             |

For the `id` and `created_at` columns you can either create them manually with the correct functions as default value or use the `Frequently used columns` option that is at the bottom of the `Columns` section. Values for those columns will be generated on insert.

`name` and `completed` should be manually created as per the table above. Make sure you set the default value for `completed` to `false`.

Scroll down and click `Add table`.

### Query Data

To make sure we have a working GraphQL API, we will now insert a couple of todos. Navigate to the `Insert Row` tab and create a couple of todos by specifying a **name** and clicking on `save` (see the animation bellow).

With todos in place, go back to the Nhost console and click on the `GraphQL API` option on the left-side menu. Copy-and-paste the following query and hit play.

```graphql
query {
  todos {
    id
    created_at
    name
    completed
  }
}
```

The todos you just created should be part of the response shown on the right.

## Permissions

Right now, the only way to query todos is by using the **admin** role with an admin-secret (`x-hasura-admin-secret`). We are going to change that behaviour so that **anyone** (`public`) is able to insert and select todos.

In the Hasura Console, go to your `todos` table and click on `Permissions`. We will set **insert** and **select** permissions for the **public** role.

> The `public` role is used by users that are not logged in.

### Insert 

`Row insert permissions` should be set to **Without any checks** and `Column insert permissions` should only have **name** checked.

### Select

`Row select permissions` should be set to **Without any checks** and `Column select permissions` should have all columns checked.

Anyone can now insert and select todos. This is not secure, but it's a good start. We will secure our backend later when we add authentication.
