title: "Nhost Backend"
---

## Before we start:

- Please make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.
- If you haven't already, please create an account on [Nhost](https://console.nhost.io/register).

## Create Project

We will create a project that will serve as the backend to our todo client application. Please log in to [Nhost](https://console.nhost.io), click on **Add new project**. Select a name and location and click **Create project**.

Nhost now creates your backend. It should take less than a minute. Once completed, go to your project to see your project's dashboard.

That's it! We now have all the necessary backend infrastructure to build our app.
But first, we need to create a table and set permissions to store our todos.
