## Prerequisites

- Please make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.
- If you haven't already, please create an account on [Nhost](https://console.nhost.io/register).

## Create Project

We are now going to create a project that will serve as the backend to our todo client application. Please log in to [Nhost](https://console.nhost.io), click on `Add new project`,
select a name and location, followed by `CREATE PROJECT`.

Your project's infrastructure should be provisioned and ready-to-use in less than a minute, and its dashboard should look similar to the one bellow:

That's it! we now have all the necessary backend infrastructure to build our app. 
But first, we need to create a table and set permissions to store our todos.
