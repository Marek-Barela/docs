# Table and permissions

You will now create a table and set permissions for that table.

## Hasura console

The tables will be created in the Hasura console.

> Hasura console is where you manage tables and data of your app.

Click on **Hasura** in the left menu and copy the **Admin secret**. Open the **Hasura console URL** and login using the **Admin secret**.

## Create table

Go to the **DATA** tab in the top menu and click **Create table**.

We'll create a `todo` table for our app with the these columns:

| Name       | Type      | Default value     |
| :--------- | :-------- | :---------------- |
| id         | UUID      | gen_random_uuid() |
| created_at | Timestamp | now()             |
| name       | Text      |                   |
| completed  | Boolean   | false             |

Create `id` and `created_at` using **Frequently user columns**. This will make sure that the `id` and `created_at` columns are automatically generated when new data gets inserted.

Add `name` (Text) and `completed` (Boolean). Make sure you set the default value for `completed` to `false`.

Scroll down and click **Add table**.

### Test

Let's test so everything works by adding two todos:

![Insert todos](/images/backend/insert-todos.gif)

After you have added two todos, got to your Nhost console tab and to go **GraphQL API** and make a GraphQL request for the `todos`:

```graphql
query {
  todos {
    id
    created_at
    name
    completed
  }
}
```

You should now see two todos in the response to the right of your screen.

## Set permissions

Currently the only way to get todos is as and admin with the admin-secret (`x-hasura-admin-secret`). We'll now set the permissions so **anyone** (`public`) can insert and select todos.

In the Hasura cosnole, go to your `todos` table and click on the **Permissions** tab. For the `public` role, set permissions for **insert** and **select**.

> The `public` role is used for logged out users.

### Insert permissions

Allow anyone to insert **without any checks** and to insert **name**. The other columns (id, created_at, completed) will be set using default values.

### Select permissoins

Allow anyone to select **without any checks** and to select all columns.

Now anyone can insert and select todos. This is not secure, but it's a good start. We'll secure our backend later when we add authentication.
