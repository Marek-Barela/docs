# Table and permissions

You will now create a table and set permissions for that table.

## Hasura console

You will create the new table in the Hasura console.

> Hasura console is where you manage tables and data of your app.

Click on **Hasura** in the left menu and copy the **Admin secret**. Open the **Hasura console URL** and login using the **Admin secret**.

## Create table

Now it's time to create our `todo` table. Go to the **DATA** tab in the top menu and click **Create table**. This is what your table will look like:

| Name       | Type      |
| :--------- | :-------- |
| id         | UUID      |
| created_at | Timestamp |
| name       | Text      |
| completed  | Boolean   |

First create `id` and `created_at` using **Frequently user columns**.

Then add `name` (Text) and `completed` (Boolean). Make sure you set the default value for `completed` to `false`.

Scroll down and click **Add table**.

### Test

Let's test so everything works. First, add two todos.

![Insert todos](/images/backend/insert-todos.gif)

Then go to the Nhost console and make a GraphQL request to see if the GprahQL API returns two todos.

```graphql
query {
  todos {
    id
    created_at
    name
    completed
  }
}
```

## Set permissions

Currently the only way to interact with todos is as admin (`x-hasura-admin-secret`). We'll now set the permissions so **anyone** (public) can insert and select todos.

On the `todos` table in the permissions tab we'll set the role `public` to be able to insert and select todos.

> The `public` role is applied when a user is not logged in.

### Insert permissions

Allow anyone to insert **without any checks** and to insert **name**. The other columns (id, created_at, completed) will be set using default values.

### Select permissoins

Allow anyone to select **without any checks** and to select all columns.

Now anyone can insert and select todos because the `public` role was used for the permissions. This is not secure, but it's a good start. We'll secure our backend later.
