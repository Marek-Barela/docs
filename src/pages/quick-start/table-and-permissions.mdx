# Table and permissions

You will now create a table and set permissions for that table.

## Create table

The Hasura console is where you can create new tables.

Click on **Hasura** in the menu and copy the **Admin secret**. Open the **Hasura console URL** and login using the **Admin secret**.

## Create database

Now it's time to create our `todo` table. Go to the **DATA** tab in the top menu and click **Create table**. This is what your table will look like:

| Name       | Type      |
| :--------- | :-------- |
| id         | UUID      |
| created_at | Timestamp |
| name       | Text      |
| completed  | Boolean   |

First create `id` and `created_at` using **Frequently user columns**.

Then add `name` (Text) and `completed` (Boolean). Make sure you set the default value for `completed` to `false`.

Scroll down and click **Add table**.

### Test

Let's test so everything works. Add two todos and go back to the Nhost console and make a GraphQL request to test if you get the todos in the result.

```graphql
query {
  todos {
    id
    created_at
    name
    completed
  }
}
```

## Set permissions

Currently the only way to interact with todos is as admin (`x-hasura-admin-secret`). We will now set the permissions so anyone can add and read todos.

On the `todos` table in the permissions tab we'll set the role `public` to be able to insert and select todos.

> The `public` role is for anyone who is not logged in.

### Insert permissions

Allow anyone to insert **without any checks** and to insert **name**. The other columns (id, created_at, completed) will be set using default values.

### Select permissoins

Allow anyone to select **without any checks** and to select all columns.

Now anyone can insert and read todos. This is maybe not as secure as we'd like but it's a good start. We'll secure our backend later in [Add authentication](/quick-start/add-authentication).

Next we'll create out [frontend](/quick-start/frontend).
