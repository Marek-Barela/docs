# Add authentication

Right now our app's todos are open to anyone. This was good for testing, but you'll now make your app more secure by adding authentication.

Authentication is built in-to Nhost so it's easy to get started with.

## Create user in Nhost console

Let's first create our user in the Nhost console under **Auth**.

![Add user](/images/add-authentication/add-user.gif)

## Install and initialize `nhost-js-sdk`

Install `nhost-js-sdk`

```bash
npm install nhost-js-sdk
```

> `nhost-js-sdk` is used to interact with auth (ex login and register) and storage (upload, download).

Create a new folder `src/utils` and create a file `src/utils/nhost.js`. Here we'll initialize our connection to Nhost.

`src/utils/nhost.js`

```js
import nhost from "nhost-js-sdk";

const config = {
  base_url: "https://backend-REPLACE.nhost.app",
};

nhost.initializeApp(config);

const auth = nhost.auth();
const storage = nhost.storage();

export { auth, storage };
```

Remember to replace https://backend-REPLACE.nhost.app with your own backend Nhost domain. Note that the URL should start with https://**backend**-[...].

## Introduce NhostAuthProvider

You will now wrap your app with another provider. The `NhostAuthProvider`. With this provider, we'll know if a user is logged in or not.

We'll also send our `auth` object to both our two providers, `NhostAuthProvider` and `NhostApolloProvider`, so the whole app can share the same auth state.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "components/App";
// importing new `auth` class
import { auth } from "utils/nhost";
// Importing new `NhostAuthProvider`
import { NhostAuthProvider, NhostApolloProvider } from "react-nhost";

// Wrapp `NhostAuthprovider` around our whole app. Make sure to
// add `auth={auth}` for both Nhost providers.
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <NhostAuthProvider auth={auth}>
      <NhostApolloProvider
        auth={auth}
        gql_endpoint="https://hasura-zgp96xwz.nhost.app/v1/graphql"
      >
        <App />
      </NhostApolloProvider>
    </NhostAuthProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

## Auth links

Add two links to `App.js`. One to `/login` and one that will logout the user.

`src/components/App.js`

```jsx

  [..]

  return (
    <div>
      <Link to="/login">Login</Link>
      <div onClick={() => auth.logout()}>Logout</div>
      <div>
        <form
          onSubmit={async (e) => {
            e.preventDefault();
      [..]
```

## Login component

Create a simple Login component so users can login.

`src/components/Login.js`

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { useHistory } from "react-router-dom";
import { auth } from "utils/nhost";

export default function Login(props) {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
  const [password, setPassword] = useState("");
  const history = useHistory();

  async function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();

    // login
    try {
      await auth.login(email, password);
    } catch (error) {
      alert("error logging in");
      console.error(error);
      return;
    }

    // redirect back to `/`
    history.push("/");
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Login</h1>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input
          type="email"
          placeholder="email"
          value={email}
          onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
        />
        <input
          type="password"
          placeholder="password"
          value={password}
          onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}
        />
        <button>Login</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Routes

Install [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start):

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

Now let's create two routes. One for `/` where we'll have our todos listed. And one for `/login` where users can login.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "components/App";
// Import Login component
import Login from "components/Login";
// import `react-router-dom`
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import { auth } from "utils/nhost";
import { NhostAuthProvider, NhostApolloProvider } from "react-nhost";

// Create two routes for `/` and `/login`
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <NhostAuthProvider auth={auth}>
      <NhostApolloProvider
        auth={auth}
        gql_endpoint="https://hasura-zgp96xwz.nhost.app/v1/graphql"
      >
        <Router>
          <Switch>
            <Route exact path="/">
              <App />
            </Route>
            <Route exact path="/login">
              <Login />
            </Route>
          </Switch>
        </Router>
      </NhostApolloProvider>
    </NhostAuthProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

Phew, that's a lot of code. Let's stop here and just see what we got.

Both routes (`/` and `/login`) are still unprotected, we'll fix that soon. When we are at `/` we can still see all todos, that's fine for now since we allow the `public` role to **select** todos.

When we login, there are no todos listed and we can only see **No data**. If we **logout** our todos are back. Strange? What's going on?

It's not strange at all. When we are **logged out** we automatically use the `public` role. The `public` role has permission to **select** todos. When we are **logged in** we use the `user` role, not the `public` role. The `user` role don't have permission to **select** todos, yet!

Let's finish secure our app by doing the following:

- **Protect** the `/` route for **logged in users** only.
- **Remove all permissions** for the `public` role. We'll only allow logged in users to insert and select `todos`.
- Create a `user_id` column on all `todos` **so we know who each todo belongs to**.
- Set permission so that users are only allowed to **insert** and **select** their own todos.

## PrivateRoute

We'll create a PrivateRoute component. This component will be used to protect a route by making sure only logged in users can visit the route.

`src/components/PrivateRoute.js`

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Route, Redirect } from "react-router-dom";
import { useAuth } from "react-nhost";

export default function PrivateRoute({ children, ...rest }) {
  const { signedIn } = useAuth();

  if (signedIn === null) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <Route
      {...rest}
      render={({ location }) =>
        signedIn ? (
          children
        ) : (
          <Redirect
            to={{
              pathname: "/login",
              state: { from: location },
            }}
          />
        )
      }
    />
  );
}
```

We can now use `PrivateRoute` to secure `/` in `src/index.js`

`src/index.js`

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "components/App";
import Login from "components/Login";
// import PrivateRoute component
import PrivateRoute from "components/PrivateRoute";
import { auth } from "utils/nhost";
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import { NhostAuthProvider, NhostApolloProvider } from "react-nhost";

// Replace Route to PrivateRoute that wrapps the <App /> component
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <NhostAuthProvider auth={auth}>
      <NhostApolloProvider
        auth={auth}
        gql_endpoint="https://hasura-zgp96xwz.nhost.app/v1/graphql"
      >
        <Router>
          <Switch>
            <PrivateRoute exact path="/">
              <App />
            </PrivateRoute>
            <Route path="/login">
              <Login />
            </Route>
          </Switch>
        </Router>
      </NhostApolloProvider>
    </NhostAuthProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

Now users can only access `/` if they are logged in. If you are not logged in you'll be redirected to `/login`.

## Permission updates

We won't use the `public` role anymore. Let's remove all permissions for the `public` role in the Hasura console.

![Remove public permissions from Hasura](/images/add-authentication/remove-public-permissions.png)

## Connect all todos with a user

Now we'll add a new column to our `todos` table. **But first we must delete all todos**. You can delete all todos in the **Browse data** tab and click the trash can icon for each todo.

After all todos are deleted, go to the **Modify** tab for todos to add a new column. The new column's name is `user_id` (UUID type). Also make sure to **not** click in **nullable**. Then add the column.

> `user_id` will refer to the id of the user that the todo belongs to.

![New user_id column](/images/add-authentication/new-user-id-column.png)

For our GraphQL API, and database, to understand that the `user_id` refers to the user's id we will create a **Foreign Key**.

> A Foreign key is a link between two tables

Our foreign key will act as a link between the `users` table and the `todos` table.

You create the foreign key in the same **Modify** tab.

![Foreign key](/images/add-authentication/create-foreign-key.png)

For Hasura to use the foreign key relation in the GraphQL API we need to track the foreign key relationship. Go to the **DATA** tab and click **Track all**.

![Track all relationships](/images/add-authentication/track-all-relationships.png)

## Permissions for users

### Insert

We'll now allow a user to insert a todo. The user can only insert `name`. All other columns will be set automatically. `user_id` will be set automatically to the id (`x-hasura-user-id`) of the user making the request.

![User insert permission](/images/add-authentication/user-insert-permission.png)

### Select

Set a **custom check** so users are only allowed to select todos where `user_id` is the same as their own user id. In other words, users are only allowed to select their own todos.

# We are done!

You have probably already tested your app during this guide, but your app is now finished. Congratulations!
