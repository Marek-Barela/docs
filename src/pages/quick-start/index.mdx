## Todo App

We are going to build a todo app using Nhost and React. We use React here, but Nhost is framework agnostic, so you can use whatever framework you like.
We will start by creating a backend on Nhost, followed by a React client application for managing todos. We will take an incremental approach to showcase Nhost's authentication system.

## Help

The quick start is simple enough that we expect you not to find any issues, but if you do, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/SZnpVck) or at support@nhost.io.
