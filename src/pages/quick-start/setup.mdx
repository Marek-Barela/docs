# Setup

The setup is simple:

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.
2. Create an account and login to the [Nhost console](https://console.nhost.io).

It's now time to create the project.

## Create Project

When you login to Nhost for the first time you don't have any projects.

Let's fix that by creating a new project. Click **Add new project**.

Select a good name for your project and select a location close to you. Then click **CREATE PROJECT**.

It takes about 30 seconds to create your project. Once it's done you'll see your project's dashboard.

You are now ready to build your Todo app!
