# Authentication

Currently, everyone can see all todos. That was ok to start with but now it's time to add authentication.

Authentication is built-in to Nhost so it's easy to get started with.

## Create User

Let's first create our user by going to the project's `Auth` section.

![Add user](/images/add-authentication/add-user.gif)

You will use this user to access your todos later on. But first, we will install [nhost-js-sdk](/libraries/nhost-js-sdk) to help us with authentication.

## Install and Configure nhost-js-sdk

> `nhost-js-sdk` is an open-source JavaScript library for interacting with Nhost's auth and storage.

```bash
npm install nhost-js-sdk
```

Now, we need to configure and initialize a connection to Nhost. Create a new folder, `src/util`, and create `nhost.js` inside it.

```js:src/util/nhost.js
import nhost from "nhost-js-sdk";

const config = {
  base_url: "https://backend-xxx.nhost.app",
};

nhost.initializeApp(config);

const auth = nhost.auth();
const storage = nhost.storage();

export { auth, storage };
```

Please don't forget to replace `https://backend-xxx.nhost.app` with your own endpoint.

## Add NhostAuthProvider

Now it's time to wrap `App` with another provider. The `NhostAuthProvider` is used to know whether a user is logged in or not.

We'll also pass our `auth` object as a prop to both providers, `NhostAuthProvider` and `NhostApolloProvider`, so that the whole app can share the same auth state.

```jsx{4,5,9,10,13}:src/index.js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "App";
import { auth } from "util/nhost";
import { NhostAuthProvider, NhostApolloProvider } from "react-nhost";

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <NhostAuthProvider auth={auth}>
      <NhostApolloProvider
        auth={auth}
        gqlEndpoint="https://hasura-xxx.nhost.app/v1/graphql"
      >
        <App />
      </NhostApolloProvider>
    </NhostAuthProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

Now it's a good time to recap what has been done so far in this chapter. We started by creating a new user for our Nhost project, followed by installing and configuring `nhost-js-sdk`, and finally we wrapped our app with `NhostAuthProvider`, passing `auth` as a prop, so that the same auth object is used everywhere.

Next, we will create the login component.

## Login

We need to write a login component that handles the form submittion of a user's data, and also some scaffolding for the app routes.

Create `Login.js` with the following content:

```jsx:src/components/Login.js
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { useHistory } from "react-router-dom";
import { auth } from "util/nhost";

export default function Login(props) {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
  const [password, setPassword] = useState("");
  const history = useHistory();

  async function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();

    // login
    try {
      await auth.login(email, password);
    } catch (error) {
      alert("error logging in");
      console.error(error);
      return;
    }

    // redirect back to `/`
    history.push("/");
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Login</h1>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input
          type="email"
          placeholder="email"
          value={email}
          onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
        />
        <input
          type="password"
          placeholder="password"
          value={password}
          onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}
        />
        <button>Login</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now let's create two routes. One for `/` where we'll have our todos listed, and one for `/login` where users can login.

```jsx{4,5,13,14,15,17,18,19,20,21,22}:src/index.js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "App";
import Login from "components/Login";
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import { auth } from "util/nhost";
import { NhostAuthProvider, NhostApolloProvider } from "react-nhost";

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <NhostAuthProvider auth={auth}>
      <NhostApolloProvider
        auth={auth}
        gqlEndpoint="https://hasura-REPLACE.nhost.app/v1/graphql"
      >
        <Router>
          <Switch>
            <Route exact path="/">
              <App />
            </Route>
            <Route exact path="/login">
              <Login />
            </Route>
          </Switch>
        </Router>
      </NhostApolloProvider>
    </NhostAuthProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

Finally, add two links to `App.js`. One to `/login` and one that will logout the user.

```jsx{4,5,22,23}:src/App.js
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { useSubscription, useMutation } from "@apollo/client";
import gql from "graphql-tag";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
import { auth } from "util/nhost";

const GET_TODOS = gql`
  subscription {
    todos {
      id
      created_at
      name
      completed
    }
  }
`;

const INSERT_TODO = gql`
  mutation($todo: todos_insert_input!) {
    insert_todos(objects: [$todo]) {
      affected_rows
    }
  }
`;

function App() {
  const { data, loading } = useSubscription(GET_TODOS);
  const [insertTodo] = useMutation(INSERT_TODO);
  const [todoName, setTodoName] = useState("");

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <Link to="/login">Login</Link>
      <div onClick={() => auth.logout()}>Logout</div>
      <div>
        <form
          onSubmit={async (e) => {

          [...]

        </form>
      </div>
      {!data ? (
        "no data"
      ) : (
        <ul>
          {data.todos.map((todo) => {
            return <li key={todo.id}>{todo.name}</li>;
          })}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Phew, that's a lot of code. Let's stop here and recap what we have.

Both routes (`/` and `/login`) are still unprotected, we'll fix that soon. When we visit `/` we still see all todos, that's fine for now since we allow the `public` role to select them.

On the other hand, when we login, we only see **No data**. And if we logout again our todos are back. What's going on?

When logged out, the `public` role is used, which still has permissions to select todos. When we are logged in, the `user` role is used instead, which doesn't have permission to select todos, yet!

These are the things we still have to do in order to secure our app:

- Protect the `/` route so that it is available to **logged in** users only.
- Remove all permissions for the `public` role. Only **logged in** users are able insert and select todos.
- Add `user_id` to the `todos` table so that every todo belongs to a user.
- Set permissions so that users are only allowed to insert and select their own todos.

## PrivateRoute

Let's now create the `PrivateRoute` component that will be used to protect a route by making sure that only logged in users can visit that route.

Please create `PrivateRoute.js` file with the following content:

```jsx:src/components/PrivateRoute.js
import React from "react";
import { Route, Redirect } from "react-router-dom";
import { useAuth } from "react-nhost";

export default function PrivateRoute({ children, ...rest }) {
  const { signedIn } = useAuth();

  if (signedIn === null) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <Route
      {...rest}
      render={({ location }) =>
        signedIn ? (
          children
        ) : (
          <Redirect
            to={{
              pathname: "/login",
              state: { from: location },
            }}
          />
        )
      }
    />
  );
}
```

`PrivateRoute` simply checks whether a user is logged in and redirects to `/login` otherwise. Please open `src/index.js` and replace `Route` with `PrivateRoute` for `/`.

```jsx{5,16,18}:src/index.js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "App";
import Login from "components/Login";
import PrivateRoute from "components/PrivateRoute";
import { auth } from "util/nhost";
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import { NhostAuthProvider, NhostApolloProvider } from "react-nhost";

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <NhostAuthProvider auth={auth}>
      <NhostApolloProvider
        auth={auth}
        gqlEndpoint="https://hasura-xxx.nhost.app/v1/graphql"
      >
        <Router>
          <Switch>
            <PrivateRoute exact path="/">
              <App />
            </PrivateRoute>
            <Route path="/login">
              <Login />
            </Route>
          </Switch>
        </Router>
      </NhostApolloProvider>
    </NhostAuthProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

Now users can only access `/` if they are logged in.

## A todo belongs to a user

A todo should be tied to a user and only be visible to that user. We will now add a new column to our `todos` table **but first we must delete all todos**. On the `Browse Rows` tab, for the `todos` table, select all todos and click on the trash can icon.

After all todos are deleted, select the `Modify` tab and at the bottom of the **Columns** section, click on `Add a new column`. The new column should be named `user_id` and be of type UUID. Also make sure to uncheck Nullable. You can now save the column.

> `user_id` will refer to the id of the user that the todo belongs to.

![New user_id column](/images/add-authentication/new-user-id-column.png)

For our GraphQL API, and database, to understand that the `user_id` refers to the user's id we will create a **Foreign Key**.

> A Foreign key is a link between two tables

Our foreign key will act as a link between the `users` table and the `todos` table.

You create the foreign key in the same `Modify` tab.

![Foreign key](/images/add-authentication/create-foreign-key.png)

For Hasura to use the foreign key relation in the GraphQL API we need to track the foreign key relationship. Go to the `DATA` tab and click `Track all`.

![Track all relationships](/images/add-authentication/track-all-relationships.png)

## Permissions for users

### Remove Public

We won't use the `public` role anymore so let's remove all of its permissions on the Hasura console.

![Remove public permissions from Hasura](/images/add-authentication/remove-public-permissions.png)

Finally, we just miss configuring the `user` role which is used when logged in.

### Insert

A user can only insert `name` because all other columns will be set automatically. More specifically, `user_id` will be set to the id of the user making the request (`x-hasura-user-id`) and is configured in the `Column presets` section (see picture bellow).

![User insert permission](/images/add-authentication/user-insert-permission.png)

### Select

Set a **custom check** so users are only allowed to select todos where `user_id` is the same as their own user id. In other words, users are only allowed to select their own todos.

# We are done!

You have probably already tested your app during this guide, but your app is now finished. Congratulations!
