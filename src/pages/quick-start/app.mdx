## Create a new React app

To create a new react app run the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app nhost-app
cd nhost-app
```

Then install `nhost-react` so we can connect our React app with our backend. Install `nhost-react` using the following command:

```bash
npm install nhost-react
```

We can now start our app:

```bash
npm start
```

Now your app has started and you can access it at `http://localhost:3000`.

Install `nhost-react`

Add config.js with graphql api endpoint

Add `NhostProvider` (wrapper for ApolloProvider) provider in `index.js`.

In App.js:

- List todos
- Create todo
- delete todo
