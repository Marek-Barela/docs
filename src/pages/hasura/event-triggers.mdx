title: "Event triggers"
---

Hasura can trigger webhooks on events (insert, update, delete) happening in the database.

> The event in the database **does not have to** come via the GraphQL API.

As an example, let's imagine you are building a e-commerce system and you want to send an email when for every new order. To acheive that, create an event trigger on `insert` for the `orders` table. Now for every new order Hasura will send a webhook with the order-information for all new orders.

In the webhook, you get all order information and can send an email to the customer.

## API

You can use any other hosting service to host your API that will receive webhooks from Hasuras event triggers. We recommend [Netlify](http://netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) because they are easy to get started with.

## Security

To make sure that the request your API receives comes from your Hasura instance, and not a hacker, you can send a header (`x-webhook-secret`) with the webhook.

Set a environment variable called `NHOST_WEBHOOK_SECRET` with a random string.

Set a header `x-webhook-secret` and use the `NHOST_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable.

In your API, when you receive the webhook, you can control that the header (`x-webhook-secret`) to make sure the request is legit.

```js
if (req.headers["x-webhook-secret"] !== process.env.NHOST_WEBHOOK_SECRET) {
  return send(res, 401, "incorrect webhook secret");
}
// continue with your webhook
```
