# Hasura

Every Nhost project comes with a Hasura instance that includes the GraphQL API and the Hasura console.

## GraphQL Engine

Hasura automatically generates a GraphQL API based on your PostgreSQL database. This GraphQL handles

- queries (read data).
- mutations (insert, update, delete data).
- subscriptions (read data in realtime).

## Hasura Console

In the Hasura console you can manage tables, relations, data, permissions, events and remote schemas.
