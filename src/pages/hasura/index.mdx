# Hasura

Every Nhost project comes with a [Hasura](https://hasura.io). Hasura comes with the GraphQL Engine, Hasura console, event triggers, remote schemas and more.

## GraphQL Engine

Hasura automatically generates a GraphQL API based on your PostgreSQL database. This GraphQL handles

- queries (read data).
- mutations (insert, update, delete data).
- subscriptions (read data in realtime).

## Hasura Console

In the Hasura console you can manage tables, relations, data, permissions, events and remote schemas.

## Event triggers

Send HTTP webhooks based on events (insert, update, delete) in the database.

## Remote Schemas

Stitch together a remote GraphQL with the GraphQL API.
