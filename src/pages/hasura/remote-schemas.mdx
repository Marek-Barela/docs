# Remote schemas

With Hasura remote schemas you can add any external GraphQL API to your GraphQL API.

You can test this by adding this [Pokémon](https://xkcd.com/178/) GraphQL API: `https://graphql-pokemon.now.sh`.

Now you can query Pokémons in your API:

```graphql
query {
  pokemons(first: 3) {
    id
    name
    image
    attacks {
      fast {
        damage
        name
        type
      }
      special {
        damage
        name
        type
      }
    }
  }
}
```
