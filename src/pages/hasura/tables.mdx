# Tables

You can manage your PostgreSQL database tables directly in the Hasura console.

## Create table

Creating a table in the Hausra Console (recommended) does two things:

1. Creates the table in PostgreSQL.
2. Hasura tracks the table and automatically generates a GraphQL API.

> You can also [create tables directly in PostgreSQL](/postgresql/create-tables-in-postgresql).

### How to create a table

1. In the **Hasura Console**. Click on the **Add table** in the left menu.
2. Choose a **Table name**.
3. Add your **Columns**.
4. Add a **Primary Key**. Usually this is your `id` column.
5. (Optional) Add Foreign Keys if any.
6. (Optional) Add Unique Keys.
7. (Optional) Add a comment.
8. Click **Add table**.

### Frequently used columns

Frequently used columns are a quick way to add frequently used columns.

![Frequently used columns in the Hasura console](/images/hasura/frequently-used-columns.png)

#### id (integer)

Creates a column called `id` with an `Integer` type. The column automatically increments for every row.

Example values: `1,2,3`.

**Why use Integers?**

Integers can be sorted based on when the row was created. They are also easier to remember and debug.

---

#### id (bigint)

Same as id (integer) but can hold larger values.

---

#### id (UUID)

Creates a column called `id` with an `UUID` type. The column automatically generates a new UUID for every row.

Example value: `cc3d4bc2-39a8-4efc-9ef0-c71b899d113a`

**Why use UUID?**

UUIDs does not leak information about the number of rows in your database. Using a UUID also means that one ID is unique across all databases in the world.

---

##### created_at

Automatically sets the row to the date of creation. **The value will stay the same if a row is updated**. The date is a timestamp with timezone data.

Example value: `2019-09-23T15:07:09.548632+00:00`

---

##### updated_at

Automatically sets the row to the date of creation. **This will update to the current date every time a row is updated**. The date is a timestamp with timezone data.

Example value: `2019-09-23T15:07:09.548632+00:00`

## Modify table

1. Click on the **table** you want to edit in the left menu.
2. Click on **Modify**.
3. Modify the table column.

## Delete table

1. Click on the **table** you want to delete in the left menu.
2. Click on **Modify**.
3. Scroll to the bottom and click on **Delete table**.
4. Type the **name of the table** you want to delete and **click OK** to confirm deletion.

> The table you want to delete might have existingl relationships tracked by Hasura. When you try to delete such a table you will be asked to extra confirmation to delete those relationships too.

## Track tables

If you create tables directly into PostgreSQL (not via the Hasura console) you must track those tables in the Hasura console. When you track a table the GraphQL API gets updated automatically to include the fields.

1. Click on **Data** in the top menu.
2. A list of untracked tables is presented.
3. Click **Track All** (recommended) or click **Track** for each table you want to track.

## Track foreign-key relations

1. Click on **Data** in the top menu.
2. A list of untracked foreign-key relations is presented.
3. Click **Track All** (recommended) or click **Track** for each relationship you want to track.
