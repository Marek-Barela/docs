# Permissions

The GraphQL API is protected by a permission system using roles. The permission system is based on [JWT tokens](https://jwt.io/introduction/). The user gets a JWT token upon login. This JWT token is being sent as a header with all GraphQL API requests to authenticate the user so correct permissions can be applied.

There are specific user information in the JWT token such as user id. In the permission system in Hasura you can specify what a user is allowed based on ex the user id in the JWT token and the data.

**A basic use-case** is to allow a user read _something_ if `user_id` in the database is equal to the user id (`x-hasura-user-id`) in the JWT token.

By default, every user has the following session variables that can be used when creating permission rules:

```bash
x-hasura-user-id
x-hasura-allowed-roles
x-hasura-default-role
```

> The default role for a user is `user`.

You can add more session variables (like `users.company_id`) manually with [custom user columns](/auth/custom-user-columns).

You handle permissions for a table in the **Permissions tab**.

### Insert permission

Here is a popular approach for insert permission for logged in users. We'll break it down below the image.

![Permission Insert](/images/hasura/permission-insert.png)

1. Use the role **user** and click on the **Insert** column.
2. Select **Without any checks**.
3. Select the columns you want the user to insert. Here we'll only select `name` since the other columns will be filled in with default values and we don't want users to override them.
4. For column presets we select `user_id` to be the value of `x-hasura-user-id` (the user's id). This way, we make sure that the `user_id` is securely set to the id of the user making the request.

### Select permission

Below follows a popular approach for select permission for logged in users. We'll break it down below the image.

![Permission Select](/images/hasura/permission-select.png)

1. Use the role **user** and click on the **Select** column.
2. Select **With custom check** and create the rule that users can only read rows where `user_id = x-hasura-user-id`. In other words, users can only read their own data.
3. Limit number of rows to 100 (or some other relevant number).
4. Select the columns you want the user to be able to read. In our case we'll allow the user to read all columns.

### Update and Delete permission

Update and Delete permissions usually follows the same rules as Select permissions.
