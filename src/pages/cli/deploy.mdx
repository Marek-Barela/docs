## Nhost Deploy

Deploy pushes your local changes to your production Nhost project

```bash
nhost deploy

✔ migrations deployed

✔ metadata deployed
```

All the local changes should now be reflected in production.

### Deploy using Git

If the repository is connected to the Nhost project deployment will happen automatically on push to the `master` or the `main` branch.
