title: "Nhost Link"
---

`nhost link` links an existing directory with an existing Nhost project. Usually after you've cloned a git repository.

```bash
$ nhost link
? Select Project (Use arrow keys)
  ---personal---
‚ùØ todos-cli
Project linked: todos-cli
```

Once the local directory is linked with a Nhost project, the commands [`nhost env:ls`](/cli/env:ls) and `nhost env:pull` are available.
