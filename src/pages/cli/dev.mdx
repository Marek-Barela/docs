## Nhost Dev

Dev starts your local development environment.

```bash
nhost dev

⠇ Nhost is starting... 

# The first time dev is run takes a bit longer because the database is being created

✔ Nhost is running! The hasura console can be found at http://localhost:9695
```

Great, Hasura, HBP and PostgreSQL are now running! Also, the Hasura console was launched so that changes can be introduced and tracked. All metadata and migrations will be stored within the respective folders created with `nhost init`.
