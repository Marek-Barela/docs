## Nhost Dev

`nhost dev` starts your local development environment.

This is perfect for local development.

```bash
nhost dev

⠇ Nhost is starting...

# The first time dev is run takes a bit longer because the database is being created

✔ Local Nhost backend is running!
GraphQL API:	http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql
Hasura Console:	http://localhost:9695
Auth & Storage:	http://localhost:9000
API:			http://localhost:4000
```

Great! You now have a Nhost backend localy with the all services:

- PostgreSQL
- Hasura
- HBP
- Custom API

The Hasura console (`https://localhost:9695`) was launched. Use this URL specifically to make changes in Hasura to track migrations and metadata automaticall (recommended). All metadata and migrations are stored in the `nhost/` folder.
