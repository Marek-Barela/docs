## Get refresh token

When a user login Nhost will set a refresh-token as a cookie. That refresh-token is used to request a new JWT-token, since JWT-tokens are short lived (15 min). Refresh-tokens are long lived (1 year).

The refresh-token cookie is a `Secure` `HttpOnly` cookie and can not be accessed by the browser because only Nhost should be able to read the cookie.

### nhost-js-sdk

[`nhost-js-sdk`](/libraries/nhost-js-sdk) automatically handle refreshing-tokens for logged in users in the background. No action required.

### Request

`GET /auth/token/refresh`

```bash
Cookie: refresh_token=<current_refresh_token>
```

### Response

```bash
Cookie: refresh_token=<new_refresh_token>

```json
{
  "jwt_token": "new jwt-token",
  "jwt_expires_in": 900000
}
```
