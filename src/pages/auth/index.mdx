title: "Nhost Authentication"
---

Your app probably needs a way to authenticate users. That's easy with Nhost.

Nhost Authentication integrates tightly with other services in your Nhost project, such as [Hasura](/hasura) and [Storage](/storage).

You can log in users with:

- Email / Password
- Github
- Google
- Facebook
- Linkedin

For easy integration with auth (and storage) in your app, use [nhost-js-sdk](/libraries/nhost-js-sdk).

## Tokens

Nhost Authentication uses **JWT-tokens and refresh-tokens**. **A JWT token** is used in a GraphQL API request to authenticate the user and to resolve [Hasura permissions](/hasura/permissions). **A refresh tokens** is used to request new JWT-token.

**A JWT-token can not be revoked**; they can only expire. Because of that, JWT tokens are short-lived (15 min). Before a JWT-token expires, the client should request a new JWT-token using the refresh token. **A refresh token can be revoked** and is long-lived (1 year). To revoke a refresh-token, remove the refresh-token from the database in the `auth.refresh_tokens` table.

You can configure the expiration time for both JWT-tokens and refresh-tokens in the Nhost console under **Settings -> Authentication**.

By default, each JWT-token includes the user's **id** and **roles** as _claims_. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "https://hasura.io/jwt/claims": {
    "x-hasura-allowed-roles": ["user", "me"],
    "x-hasura-default-role": "user",
    "x-hasura-user-id": "c8ee8353-b886-4530-9089-631ea7fd4c8a"
  },
  "iat": 1595146465,
  "exp": 1595147365
}
```

You can add more claims to the JWT token using [custom user columns](/auth/custom-user-columns).
