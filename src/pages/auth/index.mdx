# Nhost Authentication

Your app probably need a way to authenticate users. That's easy with Nhost.

Nhost Authentication integrates tightly with other services in your Nhost project suchas [Hasura](/hasura) and [Storage](/storage).

You can login users with email/password or third party services such as Github, Google, Facebook and more.

For easy integration with auth (and storage) in your app, test our [nhost-js-sdk](/libraries/nhost-js-sdk).
