# OAuth overview

Sign in users using external OAuth providers.

## Redirect URLs

You must first set the auth redirect URLs to start using any OAuth provider. The URL you specify here is the URL that the user will be redirected to on successful and failed authentication from the external OAuth provider.

> If you develop locally, set the Redirect URLs to your local web app. Ex http://localhost:3000.
