# OAuth overview

With Nhost it's easy to sign in users with external OAuth providers. OAuth providers are configured in the Nhost console at **Settings -> Sign-in methods**.

## Supported OAuth providers

- Github
- Google
- Facebook
- LinkedIn

## Redirect URLs

You must first set the auth redirect URLs to start using a OAuth provider. The redirect URL specifies where your users should return to once the signup/signin has been completed.

> If you develop locally, set the Redirect URLs to your local web app. Ex http://localhost:3000.

## How to sign up and sign in users

The flow for both signup and signin is the same. Simply link to `https://backend-REPLACE.nhost.app/auth/providers/[provider]` in your signup/signin page.

> `[provider]` can be one of `github`, `google`, `facebook`, `linkedin`.
