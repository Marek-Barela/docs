# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), also called Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) improves login security for users.

Nhost uses [Time-based One-time Password algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm) (TOTP) for MFA.

If MFA is enabled, a user must both use email/password and a **T**ime-based **O**ne-**T**ime **P**assword (TOPT) to be able to login.

By default, users has MFA disabled.

## How to enable for a user:

- [Generate MFA QR code](/auth/api-reference#generate-mfa-qr-code)
- Scan MFA QR code with password manager
- Get a `code` (one-time password) from password manager
- Use `code` to [enable MFA](/auth/api-reference#enable-mfa).

## How to disable MFA for a user

- Get a `code` (one-time password) from password manager
- Use `code` to [disable MFA](/auth/api-reference#disable-mfa).

## How to login when MFA is enabled

- Login using email and password
- Save `ticket` response from the login
- Copy `code` one-time password from password manager
- Send `ticket` and `code` to [TOTP login](/auth/api-reference#totp-login)
- User is logged in.

## MFA clients

If you have a password manager there is usually built-in support for MFA.

You can also use a stand-alone MFA client such as [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447).
