# Custom user columns

You can add any custom columns to the `users` table.

> Don't remove any predefined user columns.

## JWT claims

All custom columns on the `users` table can be added to the JWT-token as claims. These claims can then be used to set [Hasura permissions](/hasura/permissions).

As an example, let's say you have a `company` table and a `company_id` column to the `users` table. With that, you can now add `company_id` as a `x-hasura-company-id` key to your JWT claims.

The new JWT-token will contain the `company_id` as `x-hasura-company-id`.

```json
{
  "https://hasura.io/jwt/claims": {
    "x-hasura-user-id": "f1126a1e-49e8-47b9-b9cc-e6dd5d568c7e",
    "x-hasura-allowed-roles": ["user"],
    "x-hasura-default-role": "user",
    "x-hasura-company-id": "b3b70430-49db-4c06-b365-efb498e59913"
  },
  "iat": 1595247544,
  "exp": 1595247844
}
```

`x-hasura-company-id` can now be used as permission variable for Hasura permissions.

In the example below a user is allowed to select information about their own company (id = `x-hasura-company-id`).

## Set user field data on registration

You can specify what user fields that can be set during registration under **Settings -> Authentication -> Registration custom fields**.

A popular field to let users set during registration is `display_name` that exist on the `users` table by default.

With [`nhost-js-sdk`](/libraries/nhost-js-sdk) you can register a user, with the `display_name` like this:

```js
const name "Joe Doe";
auth.register(email, password, { display_name: name });
```
