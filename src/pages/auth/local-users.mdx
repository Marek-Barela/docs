# Local users

The easiest way for users to signup is using email/password. All user data will be saved in the database. New users will be added the the `users` table and relevant account information will be saved in the tables under the `auth` schema.

Passwords are hashed using [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) with multiple salt rounds.

## API

The easiest way to register and login users is using our [nhost-js-sdk](/libraries/nhost-js-sdk).

Check out our [Auth API Reference](/auth/api-reference) to directly interact with the API.

## Manage users

All users are listed and can be managed in the Nhost console in the **Auth** tab.
