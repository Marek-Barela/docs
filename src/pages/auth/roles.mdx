# Roles

Each user can have one or more role. By default, each user has the roles `user` and `me`.

A role is used to set [Hasura Permissions](/hasura/permissions) and [Storage Security Rules](/storage/security-rules).

A user's roles are defined in the JWT-token that is automatically generated when a user logs in.

Here's an example:

```json
{
  "https://hasura.io/jwt/claims": {
    "x-hasura-allowed-roles": ["user", "me"],
    "x-hasura-default-role": "user",
    "x-hasura-user-id": "c8ee8353-b886-4530-9089-631ea7fd4c8a"
  },
  "iat": 1595146465,
  "exp": 1595147365
}
```

## Default role

The `x-hasura-default-role` claim is the **default role** of the user. This role is used for every request unless you change the role manually during the request (See [Change role in a GraphQL request](#change-role-in-a-graphql-request)). By default the default role is `user`.

## Allowed roles

A user can have multiple allowed roles. Allowed roles are roles that the user can use to make a GraphQL request. A GraphQL request can only use **one** role per request.

## Me role

The `me` role can be used to set user specific permission for the own user. For example, you might want to allow all users (`user` role) to select `id` and `display_name` for all users in your app. But each user should also be able to see their own `birthday`. You can use the `me` role to select the `birthday`.

## Change role in a GraphQL request

A user can override the default role in a GraphQL API request by setting the `x-hasura-role` header. The new role **must** be in the `x-hasura-allowed-roles` array.

As an example, let's say a user has the roles `user`, `me` and `editor`:

```bash
x-hasura-default-role: user
x-hasura-allowed-roles: ["user", "me", "editor"]
```

Then the user can make a request as an editor like this:

```jsx
const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(MY_QUERY, {
  context: {
    headers: {
      "x-hasura-role": "editor",
    },
  },
});
```

## Default allowed user roles

A user can have multiple default roles directly on registration. The default allowed user roles can be set in **Settings -> Authentication -> DEFAULT ALLOWED ROLES**.
