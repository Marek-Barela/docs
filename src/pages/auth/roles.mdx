# Nhost Authentication Roles

Each user can have one or more role. By default, each user has the role `user`.

A role is used to set [Hasura Permissions](/hasura/permissions) and [Storage Security Rules](/storage/security-rules).

A user's roles are defined in the JWT-token.

```json
{
  "https://hasura.io/jwt/claims": {
    "x-hasura-allowed-roles": ["user"],
    "x-hasura-default-role": "user",
    "x-hasura-user-id": "c8ee8353-b886-4530-9089-631ea7fd4c8a"
  },
  "iat": 1595146465,
  "exp": 1595147365
}
```

## Default role

The `x-hasura-default-role` is the role being used with a GraphQL request by default. Usually that's the `user` role.

## Allowed roles

A user can have multiple allowed roles. Allowed roles are roles that the user can use to make a GraphQL request. A GraphQL request can only use **one** role per request.

## Change role in a GraphQL request

A user can override the default role to a new role in a GraphQL API request by setting the `x-hasura-role` header. The new role **must** be in the `x-hasura-allowed-roles` array.

As an example, let's say you have:

```
x-hasura-default-role: user
x-hasura-roles: ['user', 'editor']
```

Then you can make a request as an editor like this:

```jsx
const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(MY_QUERY, {
  context: {
    headers: {
      "x-hasura-role": "editor",
    },
  },
});
```
