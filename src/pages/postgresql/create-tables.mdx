# Creating Tables

As mentioned in `overview`, you can connect to your instance using any PostgreSQL client and add tables, triggers, etc.

However, those changes will not be visible nor available from Hasura (therefore the GraphQL API) and you will have to track those tables and relationships explicitly.

Assuming we have used a Postgres client to create a table called `todos`, the Hasura Console would show it under `Untracked tables or views` in the `DATA` tab

For day-to-day operations like adding and updating tables or even adding Postgres triggers we strongly encourage the use of the Hasura Console because all changes are automatically tracked.
