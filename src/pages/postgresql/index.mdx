# PostgreSQL

> The world's most advanced open source database

We use PostgreSQL because it knows how to handle concurrency and very diverse workloads. No matter what you are building, PostgreSQL is a great fit for storing your data. 

## Version

> We currently do not have an option to update a project's PostgreSQL version from the console, after the project is created. If you need to update please [contact us](mailto:support@nhost.io) 

At the moment, we support the following PostgreSQL versions:
- 9.6
- 10.5 
- 11.5
- 12.0 

## Access

> Every postgres instance comes preconfigured with an SSL certificate

You can access your database by using any Postgres client that you might know already (e.g., pgAdmin, DBeaver, or Table Plus). 
The details for your project's database can be found under **PostgreSQL**. The connection string looks like the following:

```
postgresql://postgres:<password>@backend-xxx.nhost.app:<port>/postgres?sslmode=require
```

Your database should have a few tables already there which are part of the auth solution we provide (e.g., `public.users`, `auth.accounts`, or `roles`)
