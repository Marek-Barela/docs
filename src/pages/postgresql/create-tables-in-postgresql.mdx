# Create Tables in PostgreSQL

You can create tables in PostgreSQL. But, for Hasura and the GraphQL API to pick up the new tables you must manually **track** tables you create outside the Hasura Console.

Here we are creating a new table `todos` directly in PostgreSQL (outside the Hausura console).

When we go to our Haura console we can see that the new table `todos` is untracked, which means that Hasura does not include that table in the GraphQL API. Simply track the table.
