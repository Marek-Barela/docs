You can send variables to your GraphQL queries and mutations. To do so, the variables and the type must be specified, ex: `$title: String`.

```graphql{1-2}:Mutation
mutation InsertTodo($title: String, $body: String, $done: Boolean) {
  insert_todos(objects: { title: $title, body: $body, done: $done }) {
    returning {
      id
      title
      body
      done
    }
  }
}
```

> Because GraphQL is strongly typed, you will need to specify the variable types, which should match the types in your database.

How you use variables will depend on your GraphQL client, but here is an example using the popular Apollo client. INSERT_TODO is the mutation above.

```js
const INSERT_TODOS = gql`
  mutation InsertTodo($title: String, $body: String, $done: Boolean) {
    insert_todos(objects: { title: $title, body: $body, done: $done }) {
      returning {
        id
        title
        body
        done
      }
    }
  }
`;

client.mutate({
  mutation: INSERT_TODO,
  variables: {
    title: "Set up variables",
    body: "Variables allow separation of concerns!",
    done: false,
  },
});
```
