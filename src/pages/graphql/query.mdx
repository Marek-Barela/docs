You can **read data** with a GraphQL **query**. The best way to get started is with the Hasura console or with a GraphQL explorer like GraphiQL.

A GraphQL query looks like this:

```graphql:Query
query GetTodos {
  todos {
    title
    body
    done
  }
}
```

```json:Response
{
  "data": {
    "todos": [
      {
        "title": "Delete Firebase account",
        "body": "Migrate to nhost.io",
        "done": false
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This will select the `title`, `body`, and `done` flag for every row in your `todos` table.

GraphQL queries can be more complex, with filters, limits, sorting and aggregation. For example:

```graphql:Query
query GetTodosWithLatestComments {
  todos(where: { done: { _eq: false } }) {
    title
    body
    comments(limit: 5, order_by: { created_at: desc }) {
      comment
      created_at
      author
    }
    comments_aggregate {
      aggregate {
        count(columns: id)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```json:Response
{
  "data": {
    "todos": [
      {
        "title": "Delete Firebase account",
        "body": "Migrate to nhost.io",
        "comments": [
          {
            "comment": "Let's do this",
            "created_at": "2019-10-31T08:34:25.621167+00:00",
            "author": "John"
          },
          {
            "comment": "ðŸŽ‰",
            "created_at": "2019-10-31T08:33:18.465623+00:00",
            "author": "Charlie"
          }
        ],
        "comments_aggregate": {
          "aggregate": {
            "count": 2
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This will select all items in the `todo` table that aren't `done`, with the total number of comments and the last five comments.

A great place to get started with setting up queries is in the Hasura Console.
