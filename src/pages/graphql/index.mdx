GraphQL is a query language for APIs, which provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives you the power to ask for exactly what you need.

The GraphQL schema is automatically generated from your tables, which means **zero configuration**!

GraphQL was first developed by Facebook in 2012 and has since then been widely adopted by companies such as Github, Twitter, Medium, PayPal and others.
