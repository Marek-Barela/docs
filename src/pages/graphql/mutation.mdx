GraphQL mutations are used to either **insert**, **update**, **upsert**, or **delete** data.

## Insert

The simplest type of mutation is an insert.

```graphql:Mutation
mutation InsertTodo {
  insert_todos(
    objects: [
      {
        title: "Delete Firebase account"
        body: "Migrate to nhost.io"
        done: false
      }
    ]
  ) {
    returning {
      id
      title
      body
      done
    }
  }
}
```

```json:Response
{
  "data": {
    "insert_todos": [
      {
        "id": "bf4b01ec-8eb6-451b-afac-81f5058ce852",
        "title": "Delete Firebase account",
        "body": "Migrate to nhost.io",
        "done": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Insert multiple rows

You can add multiple rows at once with an array as the `objects` property. This can be useful for migrating data.

```graphql:Mutation
mutation InsertMultipleTodos {
  insert_todos(
    objects: [
      {
        title: "Build the front end"
        body: "Mobile app or website first?"
        done: false
      }
      { title: "Launch ðŸš€", body: "That was easy", done: false }
    ]
  ) {
    returning {
      id
      title
      body
      done
    }
  }
}
```

## Update

You can update your data with a mutation. You can update multiple rows at once, for example marking all todos assigned to yourself as done.

> **Update mutations** are for when you know the data exists. Use an [upsert](/graphql/mutation#upsert) mutation if you want to optionally create or update data depending on whether it exists.

For example, to mark a todo as done, you would use an update mutation, based on the id of your table:

```graphql:Mutation
mutation UpdateTodoStatus($id: uuid, $done: Boolean) {
  update_todos(_set: { done: $done }, where: { id: { _eq: $id } }) {
    returning {
      body
      done
      title
    }
  }
}
```

Notice how we are using variables as the `id` and `done` properties, which lets us mark any todo as done or not done with the same mutation.

## Upsert

An **upsert** mutation will insert an object into the database in case there is no conflict with another row in the table. In case there is a conflict with one or more rows, it will either update the fields of the conflicted rows or ignore the request, depending on your mutation.

In order to convert your `insert` mutation to an upsert, you need to add an `on_conflict` property, which tells Hasura which fields it should use to find duplicates.

> The `on_conflict` key can only be a unique key in your database.

For an upsert, **all columns need to be passed**. This is different to an update mutation.

> Upsert mutations are for when you are not sure if the data already exists. Use an [update](/graphql/mutation#update) mutation if you know it does.

### Upsert example

We have set the title to a unique value, which means that you cannot have multiple todos with the same title. If you would like to overwrite the existing data, use a upsert mutation which is constrained to the title:

```graphql:Mutation
mutation UpsertTodo {
  insert_todos(
    objects: {
      title: "Delete Firebase account"
      body: "Migrate to an nhost.io project"
      done: false
    }
    on_conflict: { constraint: todos_title_key, update_columns: [body, done] }
  ) {
    returning {
      body
      done
      id
      title
    }
  }
}
```

This will update the `body` and `done` properties of the todo title to 'Delete Firebase account'.

### Conditional upsert

Insert a new object in the `article` table, or if the primary key constraint `todos_title_key` is violated, update the columns specified in `update_columns` only if the provided `where` condition is met.

For example, you may want to only update an existing todo if it is not done:

```graphql:Mutation
mutation UpsertTodo {
  insert_todos(
    objects: {
      title: "Delete Firebase account"
      body: "Migrate to an nhost.io project"
      done: false
    }
    on_conflict: {
      constraint: todos_title_key
      update_columns: [body, done]
      where: { done: { _eq: false } }
    }
  ) {
    returning {
      body
      done
      id
      title
    }
  }
}
```

### Ignore mutation on conflict

If `update_columns` is **empty** Hasura ignore the mutation if there is a conflict.

Insert a new object into the author table or, if the unique constraint `todos_title_key` is violated, ignore the request.

Here we have set the `title` to a unique key, to prevent multiple tasks with the same name. We want to avoid overwriting existing todos, so the update_columns array is empty:

```graphql:Mutation
mutation InsertTodo {
  insert_todos(
    objects: {
      title: "Delete Firebase account"
      body: "Migrate to nhost.io"
      done: false
    }
    on_conflict: { constraint: todos_title_key, update_columns: [] }
  ) {
    returning {
      body
      done
      id
      title
    }
  }
}
```

In this case, the insert mutation is ignored because there is a conflict and `update_columns` is empty.

## Delete

To delete your data, use a delete mutation.

This mutation will delete all `todos` where `done` is `true`:

```graphql:Mutation
mutation DeleteDoneTodos {
  delete_todos(where: { done: { _eq: true } }) {
    affected_rows
  }
}
```

If you have set up foreign keys which will restrict a delete violation, you will get an error and will not be able to delete the data until all violations are solved. The simplest way to solve this is by set **On Delete Violation to CASCADE** when you set up a Foreign Key.An

### Soft deletes

Sometimes it is better to keep data rather than deleting outright. In this case, you can add a boolean `deleted` property with a default value of `false` to your table. When a user deletes data, you set `deleted` to `true`.

Use a custom check in the permission settings to stop users from accessing deleted items.
