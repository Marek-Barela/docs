# Nhost Storage

Nhost Storage lets you handle user-generated files, such as videos and images.

You can define declarative [security rules](/storage/security-rules) based on the user, file and other metadata.

All files in the storage is saved using [Minio S3](https://github.com/minio/minio), a high performance object storage with a compatible AWS S3 API.
