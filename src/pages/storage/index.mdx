# Nhost Storage

Nhost Storage lets you handle user-generated files, such as videos and images.

You can define declarative [security rules](/storage/security-rules) based on the user, file and other metadata.

All files in the storage is saved using [Minio S3](https://github.com/minio/minio), a high performance object storage with a compatible AWS S3 API.

## Access

Storage are accessible with your backend URL under `/storage` (`https://backend-xxx.nhost.app/storage`).

After `/storage` you need to add either `/o` (object) or `/m` (metadata).

### Object

Object is used to access the actual file. Ex: `https://backend-xxx.nhost.app/storage/o/myfile.png`.

### Metadata

Metadata is used to access metadata about the file. Ex: `https://backend-xxx.nhost.app/storage/m/myfile.png`.
