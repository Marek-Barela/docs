# Nhost documentation

Welcome to Nhost's documentation!

If you are new to Nhost we recommend the [quick start guide](/quick-start) where you'll build an app using Nhost.

Nhost is a Backend-as-a-Service. You should focus on building your app, not managing infrastructure.

Nhost Project:

- PostgreSQL
- GraphQL API (Hasura)
- Authentication
- Storage

Nhost is inspired by Google Firebase, but we use SQL and GraphQL (and 100% open source).

## PostgresQL

PostgreSQL is the world's most advanced open source relational database. Mostly your client will access the GraphQL endpoint, and you will manage your database with the Hasura console, but Nhost also gives you direct access to your database for advanced usage.

## Hasura

Hasura provides an instant realtime GraphQL API on your database. Nhost gives you access to the Hasura console which enables you to configure your PostgreSQL database and even directly run SQL functions.
As well as giving you access to your tables, Hasura also provides aggregate functions, which can be used to count or sum your data, or return avg, max ormin values.

## GraphQL

Your database is automatically and instantly available via a GraphQL API with full CRUD capabilities. You can also perform anything from simple queries to complicated aggregate subscriptions.

## Authentication

Authentication is built into Nhost and all your users are saved in your database (in a `users` table). You can register and login users in minutes.

You can let users login using email/password or use external OAuth providers such as Github, Google, Facebook and many more.

## Storage

Let users upload and download files. Control what users are allowed to read/write using custom storage rules. All files are stored in a MinIO S3 server.

## Open Source

All software in a Nhost project is **open source**. This means **no vendor lock-in**.
