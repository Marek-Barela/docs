Welcome to Nhost's documentation!

If you are new to Nhost we recommend the [quick start guide](/quick-start/setup) where you'll build an app using Nhost and React.

**Nhost is a Backend-as-a-Service**. We built Nhost so that you can focus on your app, your users and your business. Not managing servers, configuration and infrastructure.

Nhost is inspired by Google Firebase, but we use **SQL**, **GraphQL** and your stack is 100% open-source which means **no vendor lock-in**.

A overview of what's in a Nhost Project:

- PostgreSQL
- GraphQL API (Hasura)
- Authentication
- Storage

## PostgresQL

PostgreSQL is the world's most advanced open-source relational database. Mostly your client will access the GraphQL endpoint, and you will manage your database with the Hasura console, but Nhost also gives you direct access to your database for advanced usage.

## Hasura

Hasura provides an instant realtime GraphQL API based on your PostgreSQL database. Nhost gives you access to the Hasura console where your can manage your schema, data, permissions, event trigger, remote schemas and more.

## GraphQL

A realtime GraphQL API with full CRUD capabilities is instantly available.

## Authentication

Register and login your users. Either with email and password or via external OAuth such as Github, Google, Facebook etc. All users is saved in a `users` table in your database.

## Storage

Let users upload and download files. Control what users are allowed to read/write using storage security rules. All files are stored in a MinIO S3 server which you also have direct access to.

## Open Source

All software in a Nhost project is **open source**. This means **no vendor lock-in**.
